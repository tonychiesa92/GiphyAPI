# GiphyAPI

* I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with animal gifs of your choice.

* I called the GIPHY API and used JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML & Bootstrap elements of the site.

* The page is also mobile device friendly!


### Instructions

1. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

2. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

3. Above every gif, the rating is displayed (ex. PG, G, so on).
